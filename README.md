How to Run the Project
Clone the repository or download the files to your local machine.

Ensure you have all the required libraries installed (use the command pip install -r requirements.txt if you have a requirements.txt file).

Run the image_processing.py script.

bash
Copy code
python image_processing.py
The script will read the image, apply a series of image processing techniques, and display the results using Matplotlib.

Check the visual output of each image transformation, as the script will display the processed images one by one.

Detailed Explanation of Image Processing Techniques
1. Image Cropping
The image is cropped to a specific region of interest (ROI) based on pixel indices. The cropping is done by slicing the image array.
python
Copy code
cropped_img = img[start_row:end_row, start_colm:end_colm]
2. Bilateral Filtering
The bilateral filter is applied to reduce noise while preserving edges. It is a non-linear filter used for noise reduction in images.
python
Copy code
img_bil = cv2.bilateralFilter(img, dimpixel, sigmaColor, sigmaSpace)
3. Sobel Edge Detection
The Sobel operator is used for edge detection. It highlights regions of rapid intensity change, which are typically edges in the image.
python
Copy code
img_sobel = sobel(img)
4. Thresholding
Thresholding techniques are applied to convert the image into a binary format, useful for segmentation and image analysis.
OTSU thresholding: Automatically finds the optimal threshold value.
Binary Inversion: Inverts the binary image produced by OTSU.
python
Copy code
ret, th = cv2.threshold(img, 0, 255, cv2.THRESH_OTSU)
ret, bn = cv2.threshold(img, 127, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY_INV + cv2.THRESH_OTSU)
5. Gaussian Blur
A Gaussian blur is applied to the image to reduce high-frequency noise and smooth the image.
python
Copy code
blur_img = cv2.GaussianBlur(img, (3, 3), sigmaX=34, sigmaY=36)
6. Laplacian Edge Detection
The Laplacian filter is used to detect edges by calculating the second derivative of the image. It helps identify rapid intensity changes in the image.
python
Copy code
lap_img = cv2.Laplacian(img, cv2.CV_64F, ksize=3)
7. Canny Edge Detection
The Canny edge detection algorithm detects edges using multi-stage processing, including noise reduction, edge tracing, and thresholding.
python
Copy code
can_img = cv2.Canny(img, 30, 30)
8. Low-Pass Filtering
Low-pass filtering removes high-frequency noise from the image by averaging pixel values using a kernel.
python
Copy code
kernel = np.ones((5, 5), np.float32) / 80
lpf_img = cv2.filter2D(img, -1, kernel)
9. High-Pass Filtering
High-pass filtering allows high-frequency details (e.g., edges) to pass through while removing low-frequency components.
python
Copy code
kernel_hp = np.array([[0, -1, 0], [-1, 4, -1], [0, -1, 0]], np.float32)
hpf_img = cv2.filter2D(gray_img, -1, kernel_hp)
Visualizations
For each image processing technique applied, the project uses Matplotlib to visualize the results. The processed images are displayed sequentially for comparison with the original image.

Example Output
1. Cropped Image:
A specific portion of the image is extracted and displayed.
2. Bilateral Filter:
The image is smoothed without losing edge information.
3. Sobel Edge Detection:
Edges of the image are highlighted using the Sobel filter.
4. Thresholding:
The image is converted into a binary format, useful for segmentation.
5. Gaussian Blur:
The image is blurred to reduce noise.
6. Laplacian Edge Detection:
The edges are sharpened using the Laplacian filter.
7. Canny Edge Detection:
The Canny edge detection algorithm highlights edges in the image.
8. Low-Pass Filtering:
High-frequency noise is removed, and the image becomes smoother.
9. High-Pass Filtering:
High-frequency components (such as edges) are enhanced in the image.
Future Enhancements
Real-time Video Processing: Extend this project to process video frames in real-time.
Object Detection: Implement algorithms like Haar Cascades or deep learning models for detecting objects within the image.
Advanced Filtering Techniques: Explore other filters, such as median filtering or adaptive filters.
